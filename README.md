# Indux â€“ HammerTechâ€‘style Induction Tool (Monoâ€‘Repo)

Indux is a singleâ€‘tenant construction safety induction tool. It provides an Admin console to configure projects, a Manager review queue to approve worker submissions and project configs, and a Worker wizard to complete an induction. This repository includes a TypeScript Node/Express API and a Vite + React frontend. Local development runs via Docker Compose, and the same compose file is deployâ€‘ready for Dokploy.

## Environment Variables

Environment is provided via Dokploy in production (no `.env` committed in the repo). For local development you can create an `.env` in the project root. See `.env.example` for defaults. Key variables:

```env
PORT=8080
MONGO_URI=mongodb://mongo:27017/indux
JWT_ACCESS_SECRET=your-secret
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your-refresh-secret
ACCESS_TOKEN_TTL=15m
REFRESH_TOKEN_TTL=7d
S3_ENDPOINT=http://minio:9000
S3_REGION=us-east-1
S3_BUCKET=indux
S3_ACCESS_KEY=your-key
S3_SECRET_KEY=your-secret
S3_USE_SSL=false
SMTP_HOST=smtp.example.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=user@example.com
SMTP_PASS=password
MAIL_FROM=Indux <no-reply@indux.local>
FRONTEND_URL=https://indux.downundersolutions.com,http://localhost:5173
VITE_API_URL=https://indux-api.downundersolutions.com
SEED=true
```

---

## Running In Production (Dokploy + Caddy)

* Dokploy uses this repoâ€™s `docker-compose.yml` unmodified.
* All environment variables are configured in Dokploy (no `.env` in the repo).
* Caddy proxies the frontend and API.

  * `indux.downundersolutions.com` â†’ frontend (port 5173)
  * `indux-api.downundersolutions.com` â†’ API (port 8080) with CORS allowing the frontend origin
* Ensure these envs are set in Dokploy for production:

  * `FRONTEND_URL=https://indux.downundersolutions.com`
  * `VITE_API_URL=https://indux-api.downundersolutions.com`
* After changing either value, rebuild the frontend in Dokploy so the bundle gets the new `VITE_API_URL`:

  ```bash
  docker compose build frontend && docker compose up -d
  ```

---

## Running Locally (Development)

Because production env is managed by Dokploy, the repo ships without a `.env`. To run locally:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with local values:

```env
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
SEED=true
```

Start the stack:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Validate:

* Backend: [http://localhost:8080/health](http://localhost:8080/health)
* Frontend: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
* MinIO: [http://localhost:9001](http://localhost:9001)

---

## Frontend Usage

Login

* Login page redirects after success: Admin â†’ `/admin`, Manager â†’ `/review`, Worker â†’ `/`.

Admin Console

* Section 1 â€“ Project Information

  * Required inputs: `projectName`, `projectAddress`, `projectValue` (number)
  * Map upload accepts images; stored in MinIO; saved as `config.projectInfo.projectMapKey`.
* Section 2 â€“ Personal Details (Configurator)

  * Admin configures a list of fields, not values.
  * Builtâ€‘in fields cannot be removed or retargeted; only Required/Optional can be toggled.
  * Add custom fields with Name, Type (Text, Image, Camera), Required flag.
  * Stored at `project.config.personalDetails.fields`.
* Section 3 â€“ Induction Slides

  * Upload `.ppt`/`.pptx`; saved key at `config.slides.pptKey`. The worker viewer is stubbed (text slides sample).
* Section 4 â€“ Test Questions

  * Add questions with multiple answers and select a correct answer.
* Actions

  * Save: persists `config` to the selected project.
  * Send For Review: creates a manager review request (`/reviews/projects`).

Manager Review

* Review Queue lists:

  * Worker submissions â†’ Approve/Decline
  * Project reviews â†’ Approve/Decline

Worker Wizard

* Steps: select project â†’ personal details â†’ slides â†’ quiz â†’ signature â†’ submit
* Submits to `/submissions` and moves to manager review.

---

## Files, Uploads, and Certificates

* MinIO bucket is ensured on demand and used for:

  * Uploads via `PUT` to presigned URLs
  * Stored project assets (maps, slides) and generated certificates
* Certificates

  * Created with PDFKit and saved to `certs/<uuid>.pdf` in MinIO upon approval.

---

## Troubleshooting

* **502 from Caddy** â†’ confirm upstream ports: frontend 5173, API 8080; Caddy proxies to those; services are up.
* **CORS/Login errors** â†’ ensure:

  * API env `FRONTEND_URL` includes the active origin (prod and/or local).
  * Frontend built with correct `VITE_API_URL`. Rebuild frontend after changing it.
  * Preflight test: `curl -X OPTIONS http://localhost:8080/auth/login -H "Origin: <your_frontend_origin>" -i` shows `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` with your origin.
* **MinIO upload issues** â†’ verify `S3_ACCESS_KEY`/`S3_SECRET_KEY` and bucket; check `/uploads/presign` works; restart `minio`.
* **Clean rebuild** â†’ `docker compose build --no-cache api frontend && docker compose up -d`.

## Appendix: Example Caddy Configuration

```caddy
# Frontend and API reverse proxy (HTTPS)
indux.downundersolutions.com {
    encode gzip

    @cors_preflight method OPTIONS
    header @cors_preflight Access-Control-Allow-Origin https://indux.downundersolutions.com
    header @cors_preflight Access-Control-Allow-Methods "GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS"
    header @cors_preflight Access-Control-Allow-Headers "*"
    respond @cors_preflight 204

    handle /api/* {
        reverse_proxy indux-api:8080
    }

    handle {
        reverse_proxy indux-frontend:80
    }

    header Access-Control-Allow-Origin https://indux.downundersolutions.com
    header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload"

    log {
        output file /var/log/caddy/indux.access.log
        format json
    }
```

## File Uploads with MinIO (HTTPS + Caddy)

- Presigned URLs (AWS SigV4)
  - The API returns a presigned PUT URL generated by the MinIO SDK. The signature includes the HTTP method, path (/bucket/key), query (X-Amz-*), and the Host header. The browser must send the request to the exact host and path the server signed.

- Why it failed previously
  - Caddy was stripping the bucket prefix (/indux) when proxying to MinIO (e.g., with strip-like behavior). MinIO then saw /maps/... instead of /indux/maps/..., so the canonical path no longer matched the signed one ? SignatureDoesNotMatch (HTTP 403).
  - Earlier attempts used internal or non-HTTPS hosts (e.g., http://minio:9000), which caused mixed content and/or host mismatches with the signature.

- Correct configuration (root cause + solution)
  - Use two endpoints:
    - Internal SDK endpoint for server operations: S3_ENDPOINT (e.g., http://minio:9000).
    - Public signer endpoint for browsers: PUBLIC_S3_ENDPOINT (e.g., https://indux.downundersolutions.com or https://s3.downundersolutions.com).
  - The backend signs URLs with PUBLIC_S3_ENDPOINT. Caddy proxies the full path (including /indux/) to MinIO and preserves Host.
  - Keys/prefixes never start with /; prefixes always end with / to keep /bucket/key correct.

- Caddyfile (single domain, path-based) — do NOT strip the prefix

`caddy
indux.downundersolutions.com {
    encode gzip

    @s3 path /indux/*
    handle @s3 {
        reverse_proxy minio:9000 {
            header_up Host {http.request.host}
        }
    }

    handle {
        reverse_proxy frontend:5173
    }

    log {
        output file /var/log/caddy/indux.access.log
        format json
    }
}
`

- Alternative (recommended) — dedicated S3 subdomain

`caddy
s3.downundersolutions.com {
    encode gzip
    reverse_proxy minio:9000 {
        header_up Host {http.request.host}
    }
    log {
        output file /var/log/caddy/s3.access.log
        format json
    }
}
`

- Required environment variables (production)
  - S3_ENDPOINT ? internal endpoint for SDK (e.g., http://minio:9000).
  - PUBLIC_S3_ENDPOINT ? public HTTPS host used in presigned URLs (e.g., https://indux.downundersolutions.com).
  - S3_BUCKET ? bucket name (e.g., indux).
  - S3_USE_SSL ? alse for internal MinIO HTTP; public signer uses HTTPS via PUBLIC_S3_ENDPOINT.

- Diagnostics
  - From the MinIO container:
    - mc alias set local http://localhost:9000  
    - mc admin trace -v local
  - Look for SignatureDoesNotMatch entries; this indicates path/host mismatch and helps confirm Caddy routing.
  - Successful presigned PUT returns 204 No Content (or 200 OK).

- Troubleshooting checklist
  - Presigned URL host matches PUBLIC_S3_ENDPOINT.
  - Path contains the bucket: /indux/<prefix>/<uuid>; not just /<prefix>/....
  - Caddy does not strip the bucket prefix; header_up Host preserves the host.
  - Client does not set Content-Type manually on PUT.
  - Server time is correct and the URL is fresh (10-minute expiry).
  - Verify by curl -I against the presigned URL and regenerate if expired.
